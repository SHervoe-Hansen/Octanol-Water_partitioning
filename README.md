# Electronic Notebook: Solvent-Environment Dependence of the Excess Chemical Potential and its Computation Scheme Formulated Though Error Minimization: *Determination of octanol-water partitioning free energy* 

This is supporting information for the scientific manuscript by _Herv√∏-Hansen et al._ (_J. Chem. Theory Comput._, 2025, doi: [10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01000](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01000)) on the solvation free energy of PEG and *n*-hexanol in different solvent conditions using the energy-representation theory of solvation in combination with all-atom simulations. All figures within the analysis are publication ready and can be reproduced by running the provided Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). 

### Layout
